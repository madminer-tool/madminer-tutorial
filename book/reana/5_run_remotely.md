# Run remotely

This section describes the execution of the workflow on a REANA instance, being deployed on a remote cluster.
This section assumes that you have installed and configured the REANA client and, **optionally**, the MLFlow
tracking server as described in the [Setup REANA / MLFlow][reana-section-setup] section.

To determine if the connection is established check the following output

```bash
reana-client ping
> REANA server: <REANA_URL_SERVER>
> REANA server version: 0.7.1
> REANA client version: 0.7.2
> Authenticated as: <username> <username@institution>
> Status: Connected
```

The `Makefile` available in the [madminer-workflow][madminer-workflow-repo] repository defines a high-level command for
submitting jobs to a REANA cluster. To launch the workflow on a remote REANA instance, simply type:

```bash
make reana-run
```

You should see an output similar to this:

```

Deploying on REANA...

## Monitor remote workflows
If you have access to a remote REANA server instance, it is more helpful to monitor the workflows and retrieve output files
from the local browser than from the working directory at the clusterâ€™s institution. Here are the steps to take:

```bash
# Local terminal, SSH to the institution hosting the REANA server
ssh -q -L <port>:<REANA_SERVER_URL>:<port> <username>@<institution>
```

In the particular case of the _Brookhaven National Lab_, the REANA instance URL is available [here][reana-instance-bnl]
(IP protected). You can check the progress of your workflow on `https://localhost:30443` using your local browser.

The files produced in the workflow and stored in the workflow's workspace:

You can access individual files either from the web interface or with the `reana-client` CLI:

You can also directly view some files, like this plot:

You can also inspect the logs for different steps in the workflow:

In case you have an MLFlow tracking server running, you can view the metrics and artifacts being tracked:
