At this stage we have a trained model to approximate a likelihood, likelihood ratio, or score metric.
Therefore, we are now ready to perform statistical analysis of the data. We might either want to analyze
real data for observed results or simulated data for expected results.

- Limits on EFT parameters (**recommended** for the tutorial, ~5 min).
- Fisher information (**stretch goal** for the tutorial, ~1 min).
- Information Geometry (**stretch goal** for the tutorial, ~2 min).
